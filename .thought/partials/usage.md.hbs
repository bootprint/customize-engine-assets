## Usage

The module makes only sense in combination with {{npm 'customize-write-files'}}
Consider the following directory tree:

{{{dirTree 'examples/' 'directory*/**'}}}

The following example copies `directory1` to the `target` directory.

{{{example 'examples/example.js'}}}

This examples copies the files from [examples/directory](examples/directory)
and [examples/directory2](examples/directory2) to [examples/target](examples/target)

The output of the example is 

{{{exec 'node example.js' cwd='examples/'}}}

It's noteworthy that the example does not copy `directory1/subdir/file2.txt` and 
then overwrites the file with `directory2/subdir/file2.txt`. Instead, when
`.run()` is called, it is evaluated which file will actually be copied and then,
the engine returns a readable stream on the file, which is then used by
{{npm 'customize-write-files'}} to copy to file to the target directory.
